      <description>I used to like playing Sudoku. I used to have an app on my phone that would let me play Sudoku. I mostly used it during class whenever I was bored. I ended up getting to a point with the app where I ended up stuck on the really hard board, and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure it out. True Sudoku fans may tell you it&amp;rsquo;s all about skill. In truth, it&amp;rsquo;s really a truly simple algorithm.</description>

      <description>When I first started my blog shortly after graduating from college, I thought it would be so cool to make it myself. What does make it yourself mean? Well, I found a premade HTML template online, plugged in some pictures, changed some of the words, and let it rip.&#xA;It sucked. Both practically, in the sense that it looked lke shit, and as a portfolio, in the sense that it looked like shit and it didn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate anything about my skills.</description>
