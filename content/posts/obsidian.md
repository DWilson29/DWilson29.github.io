One other change in the past year I didn't mention in the recent update was my usage of Obsidian. I actually started using it around the same time as this blog, but I have been much more active with it. 

# Background
When I was a kid, my parents loved OneNote. My dad would say it "was the only good thing Microsoft has ever done". I might agree back then. But now, I'm not a big fan of it. It's big, clunky and slow. And in general, I'm trying to get away from Microsoft owning all my data. Especially now that OneNote is "Microsoft 365 Copilot OneNote"? I think they're still workshopping that one.

## What do I want out of my notes?
I need a few things for me to track notes. I loved OneNote's folder system, but I don't really see any advantage in separate notebooks. I personally don't care for the "click anywhere and write" approach that OneNote takes. I want my notes in one place, all the time. 

In short, I want
- Simplicity
- Readability
- Privacy

## Obsidian versus Notion
A few years back, I heard about Notion from an old boss. I looked into it a bit, and while it might be useful to some people, it probably isn't the best for my use case. I don't need mail or calendar or AI in my documentation, or the ability to publish it to a webpage. The "docs" feature seems okay, but it has a lot of features I don't need. Integration with Github or Figma? Boards? Charts? I might consider it for when I switch off of using Trello to manage all of my personal projects, but for now I just have no desire.

Obsidian is simple. Markdown? I already used Markdown for this, so that's natural. Simple files and folder structure? Easy to work on. The Editor? Lightweight, simple, cross-platform. Coming from Visual Studio (regular or Code) or OneNote, it *feels* faster already. It has more advanced page types and features, but they're unobtrusive and limited. 

# Core Features of Obsidian
## Markdown
I won't harp on this much, but it's just so simple and intuitive to work with. I can use it everywhere. One of the things I hate about JSON/TOML/YAML/etc. is that I feel like JSON can do everything, so why switch. Rationally, I know they're optimized for specific things, and I've found TOML to be easy to work with for the Hugo configuration for this sight, but YAML still irks me. It's the same with Markdown.

## Linking
Links are so simple. Sometimes notes are related to each other, but only in the category or feature. For example, I find organizing recipes is easiest by type (Dessert, Entree, Sides, etc.) so my file structure reflects that. But, say I want to search for all Italian food. Obsidian is simple, just enter `#Italian` on every page, and you have a link setup.

A side benefit of this is that links don't have to be within the folder. For example, you may with to link `#Italian` to not just recipes, but notes on language, movies, art, anything. Nominally, this example could just be used to immerse yourself in Italian culture for a day, but it has broader benefits in showing *how* knowledge connects to each other.

I admittedly didn't use this for the first year or so, but since then it has been quite useful for me.

## Canvas
A newer feature I have been interested in. It combines the same kind of open "click anywhere and write" I hated in OneNote, but visually these appear as individual cards. And cards can be anything, pages, images, etc. I find this really helpful for showing visual relationships, such as relationship trees. Additionally, I've grown disillusioned with Pinterest in the last few years, as it has largely turned into AI slop. Now, I can have my own Pinterest, with blackjack and that other thing Bender from Futurama said in that episode! 

# How do I use Obsidian
I split my Obsidian notes into two "vaults", a personal collection and a professional collection. Both are organized differently due to the subject material. Technically I could combine them easily, but for me I find that splitting them apart helps me orient me better.

## Personal notes
My personal note collection is organized by topic. A few important categories are
### Art
I organize all of my documentation on art and media that I like. From painters to books and movies. I started this somewhat recently, but I like being able to document this all locally. I've taken to writing a brief summary, and any important themes or quotes I liked from the piece.

### Automotive
Here I track information related to my car. I can track maintenance intervals (as transcribed from my manual), as well as my actual maintenance and repair procedures. This helps keep me square and prevent missing stuff.

### Family
I've started this somewhat recently as well, but I can document my entire family tree. Using a Canvas, I can show everyone's relationship. I originally had a .PAF file, but the software for that is super old and I much prefer having it in Obsidian.

### Gaming
I document any gaming topics in here. Since I'm mostly an RPG gamer, I like documenting any builds I do in case I want to refer to sources again. 

### Life
This is my broadest, and most important category, despite only having 5 pages in this folder. I'll break each one out.

#### Life Timeline
  A timeline of my entire life, from birth to death. Documenting any events that happened, important activities I did, names of friends I haven't seen.

#### Long Term Goals
  Where do I see myself in 10 years? How will my goals change in the meantime? I can have all of the answers easily available here. I mostly ponder over this.

#### Monthly Retrospective
  My most touched file in the entire vault. Every month, I document the important events that happened. Little or big, I find writing it down helps me reflect on me progress.

#### Mood Board
  I just started this, but I love it. On social media I see something cool, something I vibe with. I can clip it, copy it in here, and drag it around. It makes it so easy to just look and reflect. Another excellent use for Canvases
#### Yearly Goals
  My second most touched file in the vault. Every year I set goals for myself. They could be simple and stupid, for example tracking which games I want to play this year. But I can also track my goals, like important trips I want to take, things I want to learn, things I want to do. I can also track standards, such as fitness measurements, through this. I should probably expand that part into it's own category.

### Recipes
As per my pet example earlier, I track every recipe I want to cook. I should go through and digitize all of my mom's old recipes into this too.

## Professional Notes
This one is thankfully a little simpler. I only organize into 4 categories.
- Areas - A directory containing every technology I use. Every programming language, editor, source control, anything. Anything I have to google to figure out should ideally go into here.
- Career - notes on my career, including a timeline for reference
- Concepts - this is a little vague, but for things I might want to reference but don't actually "use" as technologies. For example, I might not really need to know how the OSI model for networking works to get this server hosted (outside of the basics like IP addresses), but I can document the model in this area for future reference.
- Projects - any personal projects I'm working on or might wish to in the future. 

# A few final notes
1. I love having a "landing page", describing what the folder means. Made it easy to create this.
2. You don't have to do everything the way I said. You use-case may be different, or you may live a different life than me. But I hope showing my layout gives you an idea of what you *can* do with this application.
3. If you're a cheapskate/miserly like me, don't pay for Sync, just use Git. It makes it so easy. I will admit, this basically makes it useless on mobile. But, I always have my laptop with me so your mileage may vary.
