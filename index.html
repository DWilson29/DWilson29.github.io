            It's important to learn new things, and everyone is doing GitHub

                I am a soon-to-be graduate from Oregon State University, with a
                Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, and a minor in
                Statistics. I'm interested in all kinds of software and
                development. Most of my degree focused on data science and
                statistics, but I've been exposed to and have experience with
                Android development, databases, parallel programming, game
                development, and of course web development!

              Analyzing True Crime Podcasts - Simple Anaconda/Pandas Project

            <p class="text">
              This project was to get me familiar with Anaconda, Pandas, 
              and using Jupyter Notebook. I've always been a little put off
              by Python due to some bad experiences, however it is an
              industry standard for a good reason. My statistics classes always
              preferred R, as in academics R is the standard. Learning to do 
              the same things I've done in R in Python is humbling but important work.
              To start, I looked on popular Kaggle datasets, picked one that sounded interesting,
              and started getting to work to find trends and build visualizations.

              Tableau Public - Learning the Basics and Why Taking Your Time Is So Important!

            <p class="text">
              I've been doing research into the skills most companies want from a 
              "Data Scientist", and it looks like the big ones are SQL, Excel,
              Python/R and of course, Tableau or Power BI. I was exposed to the 
              first three in my degree, but Tableau? Power BI? Never heard of them!
              I was looking for ways to explore this field of study, but all the
              products are specifically for companies. How is someone supposed to learn
              this software if it costs a million dollars a month or needs a 500 dollar
              certificate? Turns out, Tableau Public is a thing, and is super cool. I hope to bring
              more visualizations to this platform.

              In my Capstone project for the College of Engineering at Oregon
              State Univeristy, my team and I made a server hosting system for
              Professor Joseph Louis, of the College of Civil and Construction
              Engineering. He wanted an easy to use management system for
              Unity3D scenes, which would let him host those scenes and present
              them in class as problems for his students. Our job was to create
              the server management system, as well as setup the Unity3D export
              template, and providing sample scenes to test the server system
              with.

              I was annoyed by the quickly changing weather around Corvallis,
              Oregon. It was always so hard what to tell I should wear each day.
              A normal person would just check the weather app, but I would
              always forget. Therefore, I created an automated system to tell me
              the exact weather conditions every morning, focusing specifically
              on whether or not there would be rain. I never forgot my coat
              again! Then I switched to Mac later that year, and didn't want to
              set it up with a whole new system.

              This project was for CS290 "Web Development", with Rob Hess. My
              team's final project was to create a full-stack web application.
              We decided to create a website where users could, as the title
              says, would let user's upload potato images and write potato
              messages. These would be stored on a JSON file on the server. When
              the page was loaded, images and messages would be displayed on the
              potato. While the site is no longer functional, the repository is
              still avaliable!
